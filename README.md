## A Stupid Hackathon 2017 project

*One of the best hackathons I've been too!*

The goal of this project was to make a webapp that orders a random meal from a
random restaurant. I don't believe we ever got it really working and this was my
second attempt using express.  

I really enjoyed this hackathon because of the lax nature of it. People were just
having fun creating wacky and unless stuff. Also because it was a whole day event,
it had free beer and pizza, and a pi√±ata fill with candy and cigarettes at the end
of the event.
